### Known Limitations

1. **Library page only:** Panel appears only on `/library` page, not on chat pages  
2. **Temporary installation:** Must be reloaded after Firefox restart (unless signed)  
3. **Auth expiry:** Token expires after ~1 hour (refresh page to renew automatically)  
4. **API limit:** Maximum 9000 images per fetch (ChatGPT API restriction)  
5. **Sequential downloads:** Images download one at a time with 200ms delay to prevent rate limiting  
6. **Position not saved:** Panel position resets to top-right on page reload

### Technical Stack

- **Manifest Version:** 2 (Firefox standard)  
- **Architecture:**  
  - **background.js** — Persistent background script for downloads and auth
  - **panel.js** — Content script injected into Library page
- **APIs Used:**  
  - **WebRequest API** — Authentication header capture  
  - **Storage API** — Token storage  
  - **Downloads API** — File download management  
  - **Tabs API** — Cross-tab messaging  
  - **Runtime API** — Background-content communication  
- **Backend:** ChatGPT Backend API (`backend-api/my/recent/image_gen`)  
- **Languages:** JavaScript (ES6+), HTML, CSS  

---

### How It Works

1. **Authentication:** Extension monitors network requests to `backend-api` and captures Authorization headers
2. **UI Injection:** `panel.js` creates floating panel on Library page load
3. **Fetching:** Panel sends authenticated API request to fetch image library (up to 9000 items)
4. **Image Display:** Thumbnails rendered using `encodings.thumbnail.path` from API for fast loading
5. **Selection:** User checks/unchecks images to download, or uses Select All/Deselect All
6. **Downloading:** User clicks "Download All" → selected images sent to background script → sequential download with progress updates
7. **Error Tracking:** Failed downloads tracked with title, reason, and position → displayed in collapsible error section
8. **State Sync:** Download progress broadcasts to all open Library tabs via `tabs.sendMessage`
9. **Pause/Resume:** Background script maintains pause flag, content waits during paused state
